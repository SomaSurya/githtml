        <p>Once upon a time, there was a boy who could do anything in the world he wanted.  All he had to do was choose something and focus.  So, one day he sat down in front of a blank canvas and began to paint.  Every stroke was more perfect than the next, slowly and gracefully converging to build a flawless masterpiece.  And when he eventually finished painting, he stared proudly at her work and smiled.</p>

        <p> Nothing from the past has the power to hurt you unless you choose to let it. If you have a hard time being present in your life, try starting a meditation practice or even do some yoga. Yoga brings the breath back to the body and the breath is the anchor to presence.</p>

        <p>We all make effort to be successful in accomplishing our goals in life. This makes us happy and provides encouragement to move forward in our life. Many times it happens that people face failure in their first step of success. It does not mean that we should stop doing efforts and become hopeless. The act of being hopeless and depressed takes us far away from success. Failure always states that there is a mistake in our effort and therefore we must learn from our failure instead of making it a hindrance in the path of success.</p>
